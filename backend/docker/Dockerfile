# The host machine makes a request to localhost:8000.
# Docker intercepts that request and forwards it to the container on port 8000.
    #because we mapped host machine's port 8000 to container's 8000 in docker-compose
# The container is listening on 0.0.0.0:8000, so it handles the request and serves the response.
